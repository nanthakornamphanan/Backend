## Data Source

This project uses malware metadata from MalwareBazaar
(https://bazaar.abuse.ch/), operated by abuse.ch.

Terms of Use:

### Modifications to Dataset

The original dataset has been modified for educational purposes:

- Only the first 500 records are included
- The header line has been adjusted:
  - From:
    # "first_seen_utc", ...
  - To:
    #HEADER: "first_seen_utc", ...

These changes are intended to simplify usage and improve clarity for students.

The original dataset structure and attribution remain unchanged where applicable.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project may use metadata related to malware samples for educational purposes only.

* Do **not** execute or download actual malware
* Use data responsibly
* Follow all applicable laws and policies

***
## ⚠️ Ethical Use and Dual-Use Awareness

This project uses data related to malware for **educational purposes only**.

Students must understand the concept of **dual-use technology**:

- Software and technical knowledge can be used for **both beneficial and harmful purposes**
- The same skills used to analyze malware can also be misused to create it

### Our Objective

This project is designed to:

- Introduce students to real-world data handling
- Build skills in software development and analysis
- Promote **ethical awareness in computing**

We emphasize that:

- Students are expected to act as **responsible software developers**
- The goal is to **understand and defend**, not to exploit
- This course does **not support or encourage malicious activities**

### Professional Responsibility

As future professionals, students should:

- Follow ethical and legal guidelines
- Respect data sources and licenses
- Use their knowledge to **protect systems and improve security**
- Contribute positively to the software community

> We aim to educate **ethical programmers**, not individuals who misuse technology.

## ✅ Added Features (Homework)

On the **CSV tab**, three new fields and a **"Load / Filter"** button were added next to the original "read as csv" button:

* **From (m) / To (n)** — Partial loading. Loads only records m to n (1-based, inclusive). Leave both empty to load everything.
* **Filter file_type** — Filters rows where the `file_type_guess` column contains the given text (e.g. `exe`). Leave empty to skip filtering.
* Both can be used **together**: the filter is applied first, then the m–n range is taken from the filtered results.
* Invalid input (non-numeric range, m > n, m beyond available rows, missing file) shows a friendly error message instead of crashing.

### How it works
* `ReadCsvRows()` reads the CSV, skipping comment lines (`#...`) and picking up the real header line (the `#` line containing the quoted column names).
* `btLoadFiltered_Click()` applies the optional filter, then the optional m–n range, then displays the result with `DisplayRows()`.

See `test-report/Basev100.xlsx` for the test cases and results.
